C++ Simple Calculator

A tiny C++ calculator that does basic math: add, subtract, multiply, divide.

Made for beginners learning C++, or lazy students trying to skip math.

Throws errors if you divide by zero or mess up the operator.

Also this is kinda my first time using github since I found no use in it, so yea.
